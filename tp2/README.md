## Project information

- NURBS: Non-uniform rational B-splines
 We implemented the 3 asked objects with NURBS:
    - A rectangle
    ![NURBS Rectangle](./screenshots/nurbs_rectangle.png)
    - A tent
    ![NURBS Tent](./screenshots/nurbs_tent.png)
    - A barrel
    ![NURBS Barrel](./screenshots/nurbs_barrel.png)


- Shaders: A shader that implements a pulsating effect on an object
    - A pulsating effect on a sphere and the color changes to red
    - 1st screenshot: The sphere is not pulsating
    - 2nd screenshot: The sphere is pulsating

- Animation: A scene with an animated object
    - A scene with a rotating barrel where on the right a barrel is rotating during 100 seconds  
    ![Rotating Barrel](./screenshots/rotating_barrel.png)
- Scene
  - Our scene is a ice cream store with 2 lamps, a big ice cream cone with two balls and a cherry on top. 
  - We changed from the previous iteration all the rectangles to NURBS; 
  - We added two barrels who fall at the same time, one is rotating while falling but both do the same animation;
  - We added a tent as a door top;
  - We added a pulsating effect on the ice cream ball, cherry stick and tent;
